Description: # SINS
        SINS is not SFIM
        
        ## Well if it's not SFIM then what is it?
        It's forum software based on SFIM. In fact it's the reference implementation of
        SFIM. It is built using Python because Python is readable. It is based on
        Pyramid because Pyramid is flexible. It uses Mako because Mako is readable. It
        uses SQLalchemy because SQLalchemy is easy.
        
        ## Okay, but what exactly is SFIM?
        [SFIM](https://github.com/riggtravis/SFIM) is a forum standard that is intended
        to be well document and easy to build interfaces for. The dream of SFIM is to
        allow users to interact with SFIM based forums in consistent ways while SFIM
        implementers can use languages that they are comfortable with using tools that
        offer different experiences in terms of responsiveness. The ultimate goal is to
        allow for smartphone apps that can easily interact with SFIM based forums.
        
        # What is done?
        The database models are written.
        
        # What is left to do?
        All of the logic that uses the models needs to be written.

# How to contribute to SINS

## 1. Submit issues
When you encounter a problem, tell us about it. But before you do, make sure someone else hasn't already told us about
it.

## 2. Write Code
If you want to jump into SINS, start by looking at the issues page and picking something you think you can tackle. We
have a variety of issues of varying levels of difficulty. Some are especially good for people wanting to get started.
Anything that involves the words "comments," "documentation," or "cleaning" or any variation thereof is a great place to
start. These issues usually involve going through much of the project and poking around. While you're doing this, you
will probably start to notice how things work in the project and start coming up with ideas of how you can help.

The easiest way to contribute to SINS is to fork the project and make a pull request. This way we can discuss what
changes you want to make. Always make sure that your pull request has a clear title. Really good titles are also good
commit messages for how to write good commit messages read [this article](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). **Do
not use poor messages because core contributors to the project have used poor messages.** We're human, and we're doing
our best. Just because we slip up sometimes doesn't mean it's okay. The community surrounding sins should do everything
in their power to follow best practices.

If you have been granted access to the code base directly and don't have to make pull requests remember Ben Parker said,
"With great power comes great responsibility." Don't make your changes directly to the master branch. Create a branch for
your work, and when you are absolutely sure that it is ready for humanity to look at it, merge it into the master branch.

This goes for both groups. In your communique, mention issues early and often. Issues indicate the most important work
that needs to be done. The more we know about when issues are worked on the more quickly we can analyze if we are ready
to consider those issues closed.
